I used Pandas to get the row and column that I needed... matplotlib to plot the data and Seaborn to set up some plot configuration... 
I decided to use streamlit library instead of Flask or Django because is so pratic for short applications / apps... I could use Dash from plotly as well... But I decided use Streamlit because  this library there are a lot of tools and are so simple to do.

## Technical Answers - [source](https://whilemyrgentlyweeps.wordpress.com/)

> What is the curse of dimensionality and how should one deal with it when building machine-learning models?

- **deal**:lidar, acordo

-  Basically add higher dimensionality isn’t really better, because adding excess variables leads to the risk of overfitting your model.

> What is the worst record separator/delimiter?

- **worst**:pior
|**record separator** = **record delimiter**:separador
|

- The worst record separator or secord delimiter is the comma, because you can used in a lot of textual columns....So...While extracting data, it can be problem to differentiate between comms delimiter and comma text.

> Explain the difference between a compiled computer language and an interpreted computer language.


Interpretation is a technique whereby another program, the interpreter, performs operations on behalf of the program being interpreted in order to run it.”

Compilation is a technique whereby a program written in one language (the “source language”) is translated into a program in another language (the “object language”), which hopefully means the same thing as the original program.”

>  How do you determine “k” (numbers of clusters) for k-means clustering?

-I think this is usually dependent on the data, but Elbow Method can be used to determine the ideal number of clusters.

> What’s more important: predictive power or interpretability of a model?

- Depends on who the model is being presented to. If it’s to business experts, then interpretability but if it’s to fellow data hacks, predictive power may be more important. So all in all, it depends on the context.

> Explain finite precision. Why is finite precision a problem in machine learning?

- Finite precision is decimal representation of a number which has been rounded or truncated. There many cases where this may be necessary or appropriate. For example, π has to be truncated. These compromises are compounded with arithmetic operations. Unstable algorithms are prone to arithmetic errors. Source

> Explain the “bias-variance trade-off” and why it is fundamental to machine learning.

- Bias is the difference between the expected value of the predictor and the true value of parameter being estimated. High Bias can cause the algorithm to be underfitted.  Variance can cause overfitting in the dataset.

> What the difference between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning?

- 


# Introduce yourself in Data Science Interview

To be honest with you guys, I wasn't looking for a job at this moment, I was just studying English, but as the opportunity appeared and I decided to try, how can I refuse it? ... I think that the big problem in this moment is that I'm a little bit rusty with the data science theory.

However I started to work with python in around 2009, since then, I performed other research activities but always working with data...and... in my last job I worked a lot of with data ... I used python libraries a lot like matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas, seaborn, tensorflow, scikit-learn, streamlit and others that I dont remember all in this moment...

I would also like to mention that almost 2 years ago I started to study Machine Learning / Data Science a little bit more, it wasn't my focus at that time ... because I was doing my research in Radiation Absorbing Material.

But I remember studied how to creating neural networks with input layers, hidden layers and output layers ... I studied several activation functions also like RELU, Sigmoidal .... I studied neural multilayers. Convolutional neural networks to train the neurals network to get the  right image .... I remember also working with Tokenization for text.

I studied the predictive, descriptive methods, supervised and unsupervised learning ... but I don't know all by heart in this moment

I remember as well learned how to do Linear Regressions, Logistic Regressions, K nearest Neighbor, K means Clustering,
Decision Treen, Random Forest ...

And I would like to say thanks to your feedback at the last meeting, because know I will focus more on the Data Science area, which I also think is more my fit.
